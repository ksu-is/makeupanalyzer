# makeupanalyzer
I aim to create a code that allows matching the correct type of makeup with other makeup through the analyses of ingredients. This feature would also look for poor-clogging and acne-aggrivating ingredients.
I will be working with Esme!
We will upload a database with harmful ingredients as well as ingredients that should match between products.
